# InstaBot (with selenium package)

This little app I coded asks for your username, password and a maximum of 20 words, then, using selenium, goes on instagram, connects to your account and starts liking recent pictures of hashtags you input.

**2019/04/17:**
-  Added a progress bar for each hashtag

**2019/04/11:**
-  Changed the browser to be safari
-  Made the time between each likes longer (20 seconds)
-  Correct the problem of space before each hashtag

**2019/03/27:**
-  It is currently really buggy and is often redirected to instagram's spam link
